# ISS Tracker App

## This app uses data provided by NASA to track the progress of the International Space Station in its voyage above the Earth.
With this app, you can access information on where the ISS was passing over at specific moments, as well as information on sightings of the ISS from Earth.

* To download the data used in this app, [NASA's website](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/ISS_COORDS_2022-02-13/r6u8-bhhq) for the Public Distribution File
and the Sighting Data File. For this specific project I used 'XMLsightingData_citiesUSA03' as my Sighting Data File, but any should work.
